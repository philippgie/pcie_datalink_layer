#!  Project:   Open-Source PCIe Endpoint Controller.
#   File:      base_vseq.py
#   Author:    HAL-O
#   Created:   10/1/25
#
#!  Description:
#!   Module implements a retry management FIFO. Stores TLPs as axis frames.
#!   Module resets read and write pointer after every frame allowing for retransmission
#!   as long as data is not overwritten.
#
#
#   Project:
#     This file is part of the PCIe Gen1/Gen2 Endpoint Controller project.
#     Developed as an open-source, synthesizable Verilog RTL IP core, this
#     project provides FPGA designers and researchers with an educational
#     and extensible platform for high-speed interconnect design.

#   Notes:
#     - Compliant with PCIe Base Specification (Gen1: 2.5 GT/s,
#       Gen2: 5.0 GT/s).
