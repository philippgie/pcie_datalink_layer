#
#!  Description:
#!   Module implements a retry management FIFO. Stores TLPs as axis frames.
#!   Module resets read and write pointer after every frame allowing for retransmission
#!   as long as data is not overwritten.

#
#   Project:
#     This file is part of the PCIe Gen1/Gen2 Endpoint Controller project.
#     Developed as an open-source, synthesizable Verilog RTL IP core, this
#     project provides FPGA designers and researchers with an educational
#     and extensible platform for high-speed interconnect design.
